# Explanatory Notes

- 1st tests in July were not temp-controlled.
-  2nd and 3rd tests were temp-controlled.
#### Naming Scheme
(Battery Model)(ID)\_(Test Date)\_(Test Type)
###### Battery Models
-  SG = Samsung ICR18650-26J (2.6Ah, 3.63V, Li-Co)
-  RS = RS Pro LiFePO4
-  NX = Enix LiFePO4
###### ID is a unique numerical identifier.
###### Test Date [Day]-[Month]
Tests took place during July, August '23 and Jan '24. *This means that the tests occuring in Jan. occurred after the July and August tests.* This isn't immediately obvious without assessing the capacity degradation of the cells. Between August and January, the cells were stored in a dry container.
#### Cycling Data
Parameters measured:
1. Time
2. Cell Potential (V)
3. Current (mA)
4. Temperature
5. Cycle #

Cycle start is defined by the start of cell discharge.
Current with the convention that +ve is *into* the cell.

#### EIS Data
EIS tests were performed at 33% and 66% charge at various points along the cycling tests.
The EIS did change within a cycle depending on the SoC at the time of the test.
