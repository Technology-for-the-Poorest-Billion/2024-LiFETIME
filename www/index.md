## Introduction


This is an introduction to the LiFETIME project. Lorem ipsum.....

## What does the web-page need?
Web-page highlighting the general context of your work (i.e. the problem your 
partner is trying to solve and how your work fits into this) and the technical summary 
of what you did and/or achieved. This should be aimed at the general public. 
Illustrations and other media supporting ~500 words of text would be appropriate. 
Keep it concise and engaging.
