- **Proposal** contains our initial plan, research and proposal for this project, presented on the 16th May/
- **Interim** contains our subsequent progress as of the 27th May.
- **Final** contains our final presentation, aimed at a more general audience than the proposal and interim presentations.
- **EIS_analysis** is a Jupyter Notebook containing plots and some preliminary analysis of the EIS data
- **General_analysis** is a Jupyter Notebook containing preliminary analysis and plots of the cycling data 
- **ECM_analysis** is a Jupyter Notebook containing work aiming to fit an equivalent circuit model to the EIS data

# Requirements
- Check requirements.txt and run the pip install script included in the notebook if needed.
