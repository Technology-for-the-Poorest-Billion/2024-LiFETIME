# 2024-LiFETIME
This is the repository for the LiFETIME Li-ion battery research project, undertaken as part of CUED's [GM2 Technology for the Poorest Billion](https://teaching.eng.cam.ac.uk/content/engineering-tripos-part-iia-project-gm2-technology-poorest-billion-2023-24) module.
# Project Output
- The notes we made (meeting notes, additional research) and draft code we produced throughout the project are included in the repository and its wiki.
- The [website](https://technology-for-the-poorest-billion.github.io/2024-LiFETIME/) is targeted at the general public, along with our final presentation (see below).
- A technical presetation of the code and results are included in the notebook final_report.ipynb. This can be viewed as a pdf, downloaded to run locally or viewed on google colab [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k9Q8pbww5nfPmVtYVi9WUyt5VJvX6cG8?usp=sharing](here.)

- **Proposal** contains our initial plan, research and proposal for this project, presented on the 16th May/
- **Interim** contains our subsequent progress as of the 27th May.
- **Final** contains our final presentation, aimed at a more general audience than the proposal and interim presentations.
- **EIS_analysis** is a Jupyter Notebook containing plots and some preliminary analysis of the EIS data
- **General_analysis** is a Jupyter Notebook containing preliminary analysis and plots of the cycling data 
- **ECM_analysis** is a Jupyter Notebook containing work aiming to fit an equivalent circuit model to the EIS data

# Requirements
- Check requirements.txt and run the pip install script included in the notebook if needed.
- Software has been verified working with the minimum version set out in the requirements. Other versions may not function as intended.
