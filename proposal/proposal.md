# Problem Description & Context
We have joined LiFETIME, a startup company looking to enable the second-life use of Lithium-ion batteries. Currently, batteries, especially those used in EVs, are deemed to reach “end-of-life” (EOL) when their maximum battery capacity falls to 70-80% of their rated value. These EOL batteries are then sent to landfill or recycling centres, both of which have severe environmental impacts including waste accumulation, fire hazard, and toxic gas release. There is very little circularity in the industry, with just 5% of Lithium-ion batteries currently being recycled, while batteries that still have 70-80% capacity are prematurely discarded. 
This is where LiFETIME steps in. They are looking to provide a low-cost, open-source solution for cell health testing for second-life battery applications. While they focus on the hardware of their design, we have been tasked with developing a model suitable for practical analysis of real-world cells. The brief was broad, with there being a plethora of methods of cell health analysis, so our first objective was to review existing literature on lithium-ion cell modelling, and better familiarise ourselves with the physics of battery degradation. We are currently undertaking this research, focusing on metrics such as model complexity, applicability to real-world cells, accuracy, and flexibility. 
We recently met with the team, and following a combination of discussion and literature review we have decided that there are two potential routes we could pursue: either, we could focus on creating a model based on Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data, or we could look at Incremental Capacity Analysis (ICA) as an indicator for battery degradation.  Ideally, we would pursue both methods, but we are acutely aware of our time limitations; We expect that our model will just rely on one of these techniques. The team has collected sufficient primary data to allow us to follow either of these analysis techniques. However, the data has not yet been used for any application other than for model validation, so we can’t say anything for certain about its quality.
We also need to decide whether we are going to take a data-driven approach that relies less on the physical cell, or whether we focus on making an Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM) and then using the data to infer parameters and validate our assumptions. This decision will be made through further literature review, and ultimately we will select the option that is most feasible for our data and time-frame.
# Technical Presentation
## What causes cells to fail?

1. Reduction of organic carbonate electrolyte at anode -> Solid Electrolyte Interface grows -> Irreversibly traps $Li+$ , reducing amount available for battery storage.
	1. Indicators -> Ohmic Impedance increases, reduced charge.
	2. Antecedents -> At const. temperature, interface film thickness $\propto$ time spent in charged state. Doesn't occur with titanate anodes vs graphite nodes.
	3. Risks -> At high T, or under damage the electrolyte reduction can proceed explosively.
2. Lithium metal plating -> reduces Li+ availability + causes internal short circuiting and combustion.
	1. Indicators -> Larger slopes of capacity loss and resistance increase per cycle.
	2. Antecedents -> Fast charging, low temperatures increase likelihood.
	3. Risks -> Combustion.
3. Loss of (+ or -,  eg Mn3+) electroactive materials due to dissolution cracking, exfoliation, detachment or volume change during cycling causes strains.
	1. Indicators -> Increased resistance (lower power), charge reduces.
4. Structural degradation of cathode materials such as Li+, Ni2+ cation mixing with nickel-rich materials.
	1. Indicators -> Electrode saturation, loss of charge, "voltage fade" - process in which the equilibrium voltage of the anode decreases.
5. Negative copper current collector corrosion/dissolution
	1. Antecedents -> Low cell voltages
6. PVDF binder degradation -> causes detachment of electroactive materials, loss of Ah charge.
## What does failure look like?
"Degradation knee" is a characteristic of Li-ion cells in which the effects of internal degradation processes "stack up", resulting in rapid capacity degradation. This is a useful predictor of cell life, as cells that have not yet reached this stage have significantly longer useful lifespans.
###### What have researchers concluded?
Anode aging (1) responsible for most of the capacity loss. -> If we can model anode aging, we've made substantial progress.
Manganese cathodes age faster possibly due to the Mn ion dissolution (3) -> Different chemistries exhibit different degradation characteristics.
Degradation (mostly) follows same pathways across temperatures but at different rates. -> Temperature has to be used for predicting future degradation, but can possibly neglected for estimates of the current state of health.
## Methods of Measurement
#### (EIS) Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
EIS is a method of spectroscopy that detects the electrochemical reaction happening in the battery. An electric signal is applied with various frequencies to the battery system, giving an output that is a spectrum with a real and imaginary part, capturing the change in resistance of the battery. It is important to note that different frequencies correlate with different elements of the battery, and that the EIS spectrum is a Nyquist plot as a function of frequency, highlighting the different corresponding physical components. It is non-invasive to obtain spectrum, causing no damage to battery, and it can be done quickly in just 10-15 minutes. EIS spectrum changes with cycle number, making it a good indicator of degradation and SOH (State of Health). EIS data is usually interpreted using an ECM, specifically a parametric model, with a different ECM being required for each battery system.
#### (ICA) Incremental Capacity Analysis
## How do these indicate cell failure?
## What models exist already?
# Assessment of the quality of the proposal
The value of LiFETIME to developing communities has the potential to be very high, as, inline with inclusive innovation practices, it responds to a genuine need and adds significant value. With solar power and other less reliable renewable energy sources become more affordable and prevalent, the need for affordable energy storage is increasing. This is matched with the increase in battery use in the developed world, especially in EVs, and therefore we are seeing increased supply of these EOL batteries that still have 70-80% capacity. Second life batteries would enable stable electrification in areas that have unreliable energy supply, for example areas that rely on renewable energy sources or have unstable supply from another area. For example, in South Africa where ‘load-shedding’ (scheduled power outages as demand hugely exceeds supply) is a daily challenge, affordable batteries could give security to small business owners, allowing them to run fridges, payment machines and keep their internet connection and lights on. In rural areas where power supply is variable, second-life batteries could be used in hospitals to run oxygen concentrators or life support machines during outages or overnight.

We have the potential to add considerable value to the startup, or at least provide a useful starting point for the team to develop our work further, be it in adding complexity, adapting our model to other cells or training it with additional data. Our work will involve the analysis of their data for the first time, and we hope that we will be able to provide useful research for LiFETIME to learn from as they go on to develop their software solution.
